Title: Instea dof friends and adventures use Study Abroad to Korea
Help us get going and fund out adventure and education in Korea!
Hey, this is Leif and Asger, we met in our first semester at DTU, studying physics, and have been best friends ever since. We planned we should go to Korea together pretty much since we first met, with both of us being really interested in their culture and high education prospects, while I also want ot visit because it's where my mother grew up but i've never gotten the chance to visit Korea despite that. 
Since then we've done gone to lots of events together and tried to learn foundational Korean skills to be ready for our education abroad. 
 - We became study start tutors to help out the study start at DTU for the new physics students which was tons of fun and we made lots of good friends
 - We love to go climbing, running and to the gym together as much as we can along our studies
 - We've gone on a couple climbing trips to both sweden and Bornholm with our other climbing friends from physics
 - Studying for our classes and exams together
 - Cooking and making yummy food together!
We're hoping we can get some funding for our trip to Korea so we can focus on our education and getting to network with more people while in Korea instead of having to work on the side or worry about our economy too much
 - We hope we can visit lot's of important sites in Korea
 - Learn Korean to a level where we're capable of living there if we wish
 - See the differences in the way inwhich they teach in Korea vs. Denmark
 - Go on student trips with the other local students at our universities
 - Be able to visit one another throughout our stay as we unfortunately we'rent able to go to the same university
Below we have a image slide shows with some of the images we've taken together or of eachother over our trips together!
